# Analysis-of-US-Medical-Insurance-Costs
An analysis and visualization of summary statistics and correlations within anonymized patient info from a CSV of US medical insurance costs.

Introduction
The U.S. Medical Insurance Costs project leverages Python to analyze a comprehensive CSV file encompassing anonymized insurance information of diverse patients. Through this exploration, the project aims to unveil valuable insights into the underlying patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset.

Goals
Comprehensive Summary Statistics
The project delves into the fundamental characteristics of the dataset, extracting summary statistics for key variables such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and insurance charges. This detailed examination provides a foundational understanding of the distribution and central tendencies of the data.

Correlation Analysis
By visually exploring relationships between different columns and the charges variable, the project aims to uncover potential correlations. Examining connections between variables provides valuable insights into how these factors interplay within the dataset and affect patient insurance costs.
